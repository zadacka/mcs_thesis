abstract = {This paper presents processing and visualization techniques for Diffusion Tensor Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DT-MRI). In DT-MRI, each voxel is assigned a tensor that describes local water diffusion. The geometric nature of diffusion tensors enables us to quantitatively characterize the local structure in tissues such as bone, muscle, and white matter of the brain. This makes DT-MRI an interesting modality for image analysis. In this paper we present a novel analytical solution to the Stejskal-Tanner diffusion equation system whereby a dual tensor basis, derived from the diffusion sensitizing gradient configuration, eliminates the need to solve this equation for each voxel. We further describe decomposition of the diffusion tensor based on its symmetrical properties, which in turn describe the geometry of the diffusion ellipsoid. A simple anisotropy measure follows naturally from this analysis. We describe how the geometry or shape of the tensor can be visualized using a coloring scheme based on the derived shape measures. In addition, we demonstrate that human brain tensor data when filtered can effectively describe macrostructural diffusion, which is important in the assessment of fiber-tract organization. We also describe how white matter pathways can be monitored with the methods introduced in this paper. DT-MRI tractography is useful for demonstrating neural connectivity (in vivo) in healthy and diseased brain tissue.},
annote = {Abstract
- purpose: new processing and visualization techniques for DT-MRI
- specifically, a new solution for the Stejskal-Tanner diffusion equation system using dual tensors
- this treatment leads to an anisotropy measure... 
- ... and a colouring scheme for displaying the results

        
1. Intro
- Basic concept of diffusion
- Anisotropic diffusion can be modelled as an elipsoid
- Water mobility allows us 

        
2. Basics of DT-MRI
- flash, wait, flash, measure
- diffusion during the 'wait' time affects nuclear spin
- get per-voxel diffusion tensor

        
3. New method for calculating DTs
- let's use Tensor Analysis on the Stejskal-Tanner equations
- key concepts: dual spaces and contravariant vectors
- tensor analysis involves decomposing the tensors onto a basis set
- like crystallography, we're going to use an orthogonal basis set
- the basis vectors depend on the gradients, but not on the data
- the diffusion tensor can be described as a linear sum of elements
- the tensor elements are now constant, and they are multiplied by a scalar beta term
- (don't quite understand how the situation has been improved)

        
4. Expand on the way of representing tensors
- given the micro stuff, we now need to get macro properties
- how to sort the results?
- Relative Anisotropy (RA) or Fractional Anisotropy (FA)
- Sort diffusion into linear, planar, spherical
- ...

        
5. Visualizaiton methods
- render the elipsoids
- headless arrows, with colour out of plane
- barrycentric opacity mapping
- difficult to see the difference between some orientations of elipsoid
- ...

        
6. Example
- 'seed point'?
- more to read
- looks useful (and practical)
- like the im},

abstract = {The success of diffusion MRI is deeply rooted in the fact that during their micrometric random displacements water molecules explore tissue microstructure. Hence by labeling magnetically spins of displaced water, diffusion MRI provides us with exquisite information about the sizes and orientations on the multiple compartments present inside an imaging voxel. Through the causal relation between on one hand the imaged restricted and oriented water mobility and on the other hand the axonal orientations in brain white matter, diffusion MRI has become a powerful method to infer fiber tract architecture and brain anatomic connectivity. This work is not only a journey that takes us from essential diffusion MRI physics to an investigation of the brain neuronal circuitry, but also a thesis aiming at demonstrating the power of large scale analysis of brain connectivity, where every technological component is essential. After a short introduction on molecular diffusion and diffusion NMR, we start by showing that diffusion contrast is positive. This key issue that was only postulated up to now, allows us to justify why diffusion can be computed accurately with the only signal modulus. Accordingly, various emerging MRI techniques that map non-Gaussian diffusion have found a sound justification. In particular it is precisely the result that allows us to map distribution of diffusion related spin displacements by Fourier transformation of the measured signal modulus, hence to do Diffusion Spectrum MRI. We show through multiples MR experiments how the shape of this distribution in a complicated multi-compartment biological system can be measured and how its characteristic local heterogeneity is a mirror of fiber architectures. We discuss in detail its interpretation and its relation to other diffusion MRI techniques. Tractography is the necessary link that from diffusion MRI provides us with nerve fiber trajectories and maps of brain axonal connectivity. In this thesis two algorithms are proposed, while the first is designed for diffusion tensor MRI, the second is shaped for high angular resolution diffusion MRI and specifically tested on Diffusion Spectrum MRI. After having considered the potentials and the limitations of these line generation algorithms, we investigate whether tractography can be formulated as a segmentation problem in a high dimensional non Euclidean space, i.e. position-orientation space. With the help of the developed tools we address some key neuro-scientific questions. Based on diffusion tensor MRI data of 32 healthy volunteers, language networks are investigated. It is shown that right-handed men are massively interconnected between the left-hemisphere speech areas whereas the homologous in the right hemisphere are sparse; furthermore interhemispheric connections between the speech areas and their contralatera1 homologues are relatively strong. Women and left-handed men have equally strong intrahemispheric connections in both hemispheres, but women have a higher density of interhemispheric connections. After this quantitative study, Diffusion Spectrum MRI data of a single subject is collected and tractography performed in order to analyze the global connectivity pattern of the human brain. For this purpose we propose to model this large scale architecture by an abstract graph. It is shown that the long-range axonal network exhibits a "small world" topology. This type of particular architecture is present in various large scale communication networks. They emerge usually from a growing process where optimal communication has to be developed under some resource constraints. Furthermore we show also that the architecture of axonal connectivity between cortical areas exhibits a hierarchical organization. These results, which confirm more indirect studies, provide essential material to discuss not only brain evolution and development but also information processing at the level of the brain.},

abstract = {Innovations in data visualization punctuate the landmark advances in human connectome research since its beginnings. From tensor glyphs for diffusion-weighted imaging, to advanced rendering of anatomical tracts, to more recent graph-based representations of functional connectivity data, many of the ways we have come to understand the human connectome are through the intuitive insight these visualizations enable. Nonetheless, several unresolved problems persist. For example, probabilistic tractography lacks the visual appeal of its deterministic equivalent, multimodal representations require extreme levels of data reduction, and rendering the full connectome within an anatomical space makes the contents cluttered and unreadable. In part, these challenges require compromises between several tensions that determine connectome visualization practice, such as prioritizing anatomic or connectomic information, aesthetic appeal or information content, and thoroughness or readability. To illustrate the ongoing negotiation between these priorities, we provide an overview of various visualization methods that have evolved for anatomical and functional connectivity data. We then describe interactive visualization tools currently available for use in research, and we conclude with concerns and developments in the presentation of connectivity results. ?? 2013.},

However, with the singular exception of the C. elegans microscale connectome, there are no complete connectivity data sets in other species. Here we report a brain-wide, cellular-level, mesoscale connectome for the mouse. The Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas uses enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-expressing adeno-associated viral vectors to trace axonal projections from defined regions and cell types, and high-throughput serial two-photon tomography to image the EGFP-labelled axons throughout the brain. This systematic and standardized approach allows spatial registration of individual experiments into a common three dimensional (3D) reference space, resulting in a whole-brain connectivity matrix. A computational model yields insights into connectional strength distribution, symmetry and other network properties. Virtual tractography illustrates 3D topography among interconnected regions. Cortico-thalamic pathway analysis demonstrates segregation and integration of parallel pathways. The Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas is a freely available, foundational resource for structural and functional investigations into the neural circuits that support behavioural and cognitive processes in health and disease.},

abstract = {Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) of the human brain, coupled with tractography techniques, enable the extraction of large-collections of three-dimensional tract pathways per subject. These pathways and pathway bundles represent the connectivity between different brain regions and are critical for the understanding of brain related diseases. A flexible and efficient GPU-based rendering technique for DTI tractography data is presented that addresses common performance bottlenecks and image-quality issues, allowing interactive render rates to be achieved on commodity hardware. An occlusion query-based pathway LoD management system for streamlines/streamtubes/tuboids is introduced that optimizes input geometry, vertex processing, and fragment processing loads, and helps reduce overdraw. The tuboid, a fully-shaded streamtube impostor constructed entirely on the GPU from streamline vertices, is also introduced. Unlike full streamtubes and other impostor constructs, tuboids require little to no preprocessing or extra space over the original streamline data. The supported fragment processing levels of detail range from texture-based draft shading to full raycast normal computation, Phong shading, environment mapping, and curvature-correct text labeling. The presented text labeling technique for tuboids provides adaptive, aesthetically pleasing labels that appear attached to the surface of the tubes. Furthermore, an occlusion query aggregating and scheduling scheme for tuboids is described that reduces the query overhead. Results for a tractography dataset are presented, and demonstrate that LoD-managed tuboids offer benefits over traditional streamtubes both in performance and appearance.},

In diffusion tensor visualization, glyphs are typically used to meet the first goal, and methods such as texture synthesis or fiber tractography can address the second. We adapt particle systems originally developed for surface modeling and anisotropic mesh generation to enhance the utility of glyph-based tensor visualizations. By carefully distributing glyphs throughout the field (either on a slice, or in the volume) into a dense packing, using potential energy profiles shaped by the local tensor value, we remove undue visual emphasis of the regular sampling grid of the data, and the underlying continuous features become more apparent. The method is demonstrated on a DT-MRI scan of a patient with a brain tumor.},
